# REST PHPlease
REST PHPlease is a solution to a problem I've encountered all too often building smaller websites -- 
needing a lightweight RESTful API implementation to transport data between PHP/MySQL server-sides and JavaScript 
front-ends.

Don't be mislead, this is not a comprehensive REST solution for PHP. For projects that have limited-scope, 
limited-complexity, and especially limited-budget, this is a simple scaffold to help separate concerns and provide
additional RESTful functionality to your projects.
